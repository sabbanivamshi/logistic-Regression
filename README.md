## Project Title
To predict the heart attack disease for organization WHO,using machine learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease will increasing manner or decreasing manner
## Problem Statement
A WHO estimated 12 million death records.One of them half off the death result is found in US.The research intenders the researchers scholar pointout the most relevant risk factor of heartattack As a datascience engineer predict the overall risk using machine learning alogorithm which is called as logistic regression
# Task 1
import the libraries
# Task2

# Conculsion
According to the model analysis the logistic regression algorithm works successfully with 0.6 accuracy.
The accuracy shows that building the model is successfull.
